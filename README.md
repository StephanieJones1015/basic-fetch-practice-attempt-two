# basic-fetch-practice-attempt-two
Purpose:

The purpose of this repo is to deploy a static site that contains a couple JSON files generated by Mockaroo. The point of th exercise is to practice fetching data and manipulating it. 

This assignment uses css, javascript and html. I intitally started this repo and did not notice that it said static; thus, I started a new repo and used on these three. The requests were made to https://dan-collins-dev.github.io/dummy-data-fetching-repo/data/users.json.

The requirements for the assignment include:

Must be responsive	Use a layout system and media queries to ensure that the page looks responsive across many devices and screen sizes.
Dynamically create, add, and remove HTML elements.	Every "User Card" will be created and removed via your JavaScript.
Fetch and use the returned data.	You will use the data fetched to to populate your dynamically created "User Cards."
Create two buttons to get and handle data.	You will create buttons that perform actions. The first fetches all the data and creates the "User Cards." The second fetches all the data, but filters out any User who has been employed at their company for 10 years or more. Generate cards for the remaining users and display them.
Create a button to clear the cards	This button will remove all the cards from page.
